# gitSync
A program that lets you sync online git repositories to a destination on your computer automatically!
NOTE: Please only use releases, as they are stable and WILL work!

# Settings
  1. How often it reinstalls for new files
  2. What to install
  3. Where to put it
  
#Changing the Settings (Follow for first run)
  1. Right-click on gitSync.bat
  2. Edit with NotePad (Sorry mac, Windows only!)
  3. On the second line, change it to a github repository url and add .zip on the end (Example for mine: http://www.github.com/ScriptnLua/gitSync.zip)
  4. On the third line, change the destination of the file ( Example for gmod: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Garrys Mod\garrysmod\addons)
  5. Finally, on the last line, change it to the same thing as step 4 but with the zip on the end (Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Garrys Mod\garrysmod\addons\gitSync.zip)
